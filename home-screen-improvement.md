# Home Screen Improvement Ideas

- Add a concise header such as "My Cards" above the search bar, tighten the search input height, and use a soft inset shadow so it feels like a pill-style action instead of a large text box.
- Restyle the reminder banner with an accent tint or bell icon, align the `View` CTA with the title, and keep spacing tight so it reads as a tappable alert.
- Give consecutive cards staggered shadows or subtle brand accent stripes so multiple cards feel layered and easy to scan.
- Move the “Next bill in _n_ days” text into a chip under the card-type badge to keep metadata grouped and avoid crowding the card number row.
- Add extra bottom padding or a fade-out gradient so cards never sit behind the floating action button.
- Introduce light micro-interactions (haptic + quick scale on press, reminder banner feedback) to make the screen feel more responsive.
